This Python script extracts .log files from an NTFS filesystem inside a forensic disk image (output.raw). It does this by:
ðŸ”¹ Step-by-Step Breakdown
Opens the disk image (output.raw) using pytsk3, treating it as a read-only disk.
Locates the NTFS partition (assumes it starts at sector 63 * 512).
Navigates the file system recursively from the root directory /.
Searches for all .log files inside folders and subfolders.
Extracts each log file to a local directory (D:\Digital forensics\Logs).
ðŸ”¹ Key Functions
TSK_IMG_INFO â†’ Opens the disk image and allows reading data.
find_log_files â†’ Scans for .log files inside the NTFS filesystem.
extract_file â†’ Reads and writes the found log files to a new location.
ðŸ”¹ What You Get
âœ… Extracted log files stored in D:\Digital forensics\Logs\.
âœ… Scans hidden directories, system folders, and deep subdirectories.
âœ… Works on Windows forensic images (like EnCase .E01 converted to .raw).
